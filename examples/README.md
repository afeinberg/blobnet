# Blobnet Scripts

These scripts can be used to run blobnet or test an existing blobnet instance.
Generally they take CLI arguments, and you can see the help for each script by
passing the `--help` flag.

Run an example with the command:

```bash
cargo run --release --example EXAMPLE_NAME -- ARGS...
```

Note that you should pass `--release` to get the best performance.
